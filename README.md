# React-Checkers
This is 100% my own creation. Just trying to level up my react skills a little. This is not intended to be deployed anywhere but it is my original work. 

So far players can
- load the checker board
- take turns moving pieces around the board
- do single jumps of each other

Still to be done
- implement double jumps 
- implement king feature
- enable winning 
- add scoreboard
